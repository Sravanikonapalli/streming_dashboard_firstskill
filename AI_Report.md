# AI Report – Streaming Dashboard Clone

## Project Overview
This project is a simplified streaming dashboard inspired by Netflix, built using Next.js 14 with the App Router, TypeScript, and local CSS. It fetches movie data from the OMDB API and displays it in a visually appealing way, featuring a hero banner and detailed pages for individual movies.

## AI Tools Used
During development, I used **ChatGPT** to assist with specific Next.js concepts and coding patterns. The AI helped me:

- Understand and implement **Next.js 14 App Router** features, including Server and Client Components.
- Correctly set up **dynamic routing** for movie detail pages (`app/movie/[id]/page.tsx`) and handle async `params`.
- Structure components such as **HeroBanner**, **MovieRow**, and **MovieCard** efficiently.


The AI was mostly used as an assistant to help me write cleaner and more efficient Next.js code, and to solve some framework-specific issues much faster. I implemented all final code integrations and styling myself.
